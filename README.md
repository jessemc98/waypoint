### Waypoint
Just a fun project done over a weekend to experiment with implementing a waypoint system and pathfinding in javascript.

## Installing
Clone this repository and then run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

`npm run serve` serves a development server on `localhost:3000` with a playable prototype of the game.
`npm start` runs webpack with the --watch param to handle bundling of es6 modules.
